CC mini project
This project was very challenging for me.  I have no formal training or experience in coding but I’ve tinkered with it on occasion.  I had never used Atom or Notepad++ before but after trying them both out I found Notepad to be more user friendly especially for beginners.  The first few instructions were easy for me to figure out because either the code had words that I was looking for or the instructions gave hints like “style”.  It got difficult for me at number eight.  There were no cues or clues to assist me so I turned to internet tutorials.  Once I figured out the code, I had difficulty finding exactly where to place it so it had the desired effect.  When my 13yr old son came home from school, he came down to my office to check on me and I showed him my progress and explained to him where I was stuck.  He immediately knew how to help me.  He has been learning to code on the Roblox platform and that was where I got the little knowledge that I had about coding.  Sitting with me, he explained that he had run into something similar when trying to code a Roblox game and talked me through the 8th question.  He taught me about using the “inspect element” selection to assist me with what I was trying to accomplish and I was able to get through quicker with his guidance.  The project allowed me to see what I would be getting into and has strengthened my desire to enter the Cleveland Codes program. I’m very excited about the program.
